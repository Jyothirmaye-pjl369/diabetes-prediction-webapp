# 🔧 Render Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue: 404 Not Found

Your app deployed successfully but is showing "404 Not Found". Here are the fixes I've implemented and steps to verify:

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Error Handling**
- Added try-catch blocks around model loading
- Added fallback for template rendering
- Default accuracy value if model training fails

### 2. **Debug Routes Added**
```
/health - Health check endpoint
/test - Simple test route
```

### 3. **Updated Render Configuration**
- Enhanced gunicorn command with better logging
- Changed health check from `/` to `/health`
- Added `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` for better logging

### 4. **Model Loading Improvements**
- Better error messages for model/scaler loading
- Graceful fallback if files are missing

## 🔍 How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Test Routes
Try these URLs in your browser:
```
https://diabetes-prediction-webapp-gx70.onrender.com/test
https://diabetes-prediction-webapp-gx70.onrender.com/health
```

### Step 2: Check Render Logs
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Logs" tab
4. Look for any error messages

### Step 3: Wait for Redeployment
- Your app should redeploy automatically after the git push
- This takes 5-10 minutes
- Watch the build logs in Render dashboard

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Model Files Missing
**Symptoms**: App starts but predictions fail
**Solution**: Model files (.pkl) should be in the repository
```bash
# Check if files exist
ls -la *.pkl
```

### Issue 2: Template Not Found
**Symptoms**: 404 on main route
**Solution**: Verify template path
```
templates/index_simple.html
```

### Issue 3: Build Failures
**Symptoms**: Deployment fails
**Solution**: Check requirements.txt
```
flask>=2.0.0
flask-cors>=3.0.0
pandas>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.21.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
gunicorn>=20.1.0
```

### Issue 4: Memory Issues
**Symptoms**: App crashes or fails to start
**Solution**: 
- Free tier has 512MB RAM limit
- Large model files might cause issues
- Consider model optimization

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After redeployment, verify:
- [ ] `/test` route works
- [ ] `/health` route returns JSON
- [ ] Main route `/` loads without 404
- [ ] Check Render logs for errors
- [ ] Model accuracy appears in health check

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Simplified Deployment
If issues persist, try a minimal version:
```python
# Minimal app.py for testing
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "<h1>Diabetes App - Working!</h1>"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Option 2: Local Testing
Test locally with production settings:
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=production
gunicorn app_simple:app --bind 0.0.0.0:5000
```

### Option 3: Check File Sizes
Large model files might cause issues:
```bash
# Check file sizes
ls -lh *.pkl
```

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Wait 10 minutes** for automatic redeployment
2. **Try the test routes** mentioned above
3. **Check Render logs** for specific errors
4. **Report back** with what you see

The fixes should resolve the 404 issue. Your app will be working shortly!
